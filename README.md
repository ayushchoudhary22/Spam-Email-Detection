# ðŸ“§ Spam Email Detection using Hybrid ML and CNN-based DL Models

This repository implements a powerful email spam detection system using both traditional **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning (CNN)** models. The goal is to accurately classify email messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Spam emails are not just annoyingâ€”they're often dangerous. From phishing scams to malicious links, spam emails cost billions each year in damages and lost time. In this project:

- We apply **two models**:
  - A **Hybrid ML model** using Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest
  - A **CNN-based Deep Learning model**
- We compare performance and discuss results
- Built for accuracy, speed, and real-world readiness

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- Source: [UCI SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
- ~5,500 SMS text messages
- Labels: `ham` (0), `spam` (1)

## ðŸ§  Models Used

### ðŸ”¹ Hybrid Machine Learning Model
- Feature extraction: **TF-IDF with bigrams**
- Classifiers:  
  - Naive Bayes (`alpha=0.1`)  
  - Linear SVM (`C=10`)  
  - Random Forest (`n_estimators=200`)
- Combined using `VotingClassifier`

### ðŸ”¹ CNN Deep Learning Model
- Preprocessing: **Tokenization + Padding**
- Layers:
  - Embedding â†’ Conv1D â†’ GlobalMaxPooling â†’ Dense + Dropout â†’ Sigmoid
- Training:
  - 30 epochs, batch size 64
  - Binary crossentropy, class weights

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

| Metric        | Hybrid ML | CNN DL |
|---------------|-----------|--------|
| Accuracy      | 97.66%    | 98.83% |
| Spam Recall   | 0.83      | High   |
| Spam Precision| 1.00      | High   |

- âœ… CNN performed slightly better in recall and generalization  
- âœ… Hybrid model was faster and simpler to train
